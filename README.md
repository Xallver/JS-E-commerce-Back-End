## Description

This application is the back end of a e-commerce website. It contains models and routes for a variety of products, product categories, and product tags, and connects to a MySQL database. Using Insomnia, various routes (GET, GET by id, POST, PUT, and DELETE) for these three items can be visualized, as the application currently has no front end.



## Installations

    npm install
    npm i mysql
